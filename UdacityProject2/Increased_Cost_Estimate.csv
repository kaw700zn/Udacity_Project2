"When dealing with increased budget, I was thinking of two things, increased redundancy and performance optimization. I achived the redundancy by making my RDS servers multi region with replicas. I also added CloudWatch service",,,,,,,,
in case of any issues I would have alarms and monitoring. The perfomance gain I achieved by adding ElastiCache so that the data is not being returned from the database. I also moved some servers closer to the customers.,,,,,,,,
